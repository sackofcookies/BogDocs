Metal of unknown composition mined from the bogs near Bogland. it has amazing properties but is nearly impossible to use. very few forges are capable of using it. an important property is its elasticity.  Rather than something like gunpowder, Boggish ballistics tend to use Abyssal steel to fire projectiles. Abyssal steel wires are also an important part of channeling power and using data from [[Technopath|Technopaths]]. due to difficulty of forging, its need elsewhere in the Boggish military and the uselessness of armor in the current Boggish military doctrine, only one suit of armor has ever been made of Abyssal Steel. that, of course, being the suit belonging to the last [[Church of the Bogfather#Avatars| Avatar of War]], [[Syrr George Toadsquire]]. in order to forge Abyssal Steel, great amounts of heat are needed. Also a [[Technopath]] must be used to expose the steel to the astral wastes to bring the steel to a more pliable state. this, of course, kills the [[Technopath]]. as such, many [[Technopath|Technopaths]] are killed everyday in the assembly lines at the bottom of [[Worlds End]].
