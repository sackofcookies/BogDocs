Some Boggish machines need some amount of computation or connection to one another. To power these, The [[Unseen]] developed Technopaths. Technopaths are created with mental and physical modifications to an individual similar to those done in the [[Bogbody Project]]. it creates an individual whose mind is primed to be taken by a machine. generally the process of using a Technopath is lethal to the Technopath. as such, Technopaths are created from enemies of the Bogfather as a sort of form of execution. Machines that require a Technopath will do one of the following:
- quickly load instructions into the Technopath's mind as a sort of Program. Allowing computations and other algorithms to be completed with great efficiency. the sudden rush of power into the mind tends to be lethal.
- Provide a connection to transfer data and other resources through the astral wastes to another Boggish machine or location. The Technopath generally stays alive for the duration of the connection but is killed when it is closed. 
due to the similarities in the procedures done to the body, Technopath corpses are great candidates for the [[Bogbody Project]].
