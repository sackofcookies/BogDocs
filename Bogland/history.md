- #### before Bogland
	- an ulitharid and several other illithids  arrive in the underdark below the land that is to become Bogland and begin establishing a colony. 
	- at some point, as the colony grows, the ulitharid becomes an elder brain (as is how illithid colonies start).
	- a bit after this, a large group of mostly human and halfling sheep herders are driven out of their homes (why is not really important at this point, it happened too long ago) and start living in the land that is to become Bogland.
	- as the population expands, they split up into many micro-states across the area.
	- wars over the very little usable land are waged between micro-states as populations increase.
	- a tumor forms in the elder brain beneath Bogland and it loses its ability to perform ceremorphosis. the colony attempts to remove the tumor. however, it is deemed too risky. they begin to explore other avenues of expansion and development. 
	- illithids begin investigating the land above and find the warring micro-states
	- seeing the accelerated pace of technological development brought on by the wars. the colony approaches the leaders of the state that was set up at the top of the tallest mountain in Bogland. the colony offered to help further their conquest in exchange for a price that would be payed at a later date. 
	- the leaders, of course, accept the offer
	- with the help of the colony, they start winning. 
	- for the first time Bogland is united under one crown and the first Boggish barony is put in place. the colony continues to lead Bogland as the [[Unseen]]
