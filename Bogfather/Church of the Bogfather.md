 the church of the Bogfather was created fairly early on in Bogland history with three main purposes:
 1. keep the people in a state so that the [[Unseen]] can continue to benefit from the people's technology
 2. explain away the moments when the [[Unseen]] interacts with the people
 3. keep the Boggish people at war so that they continue to develop new technologies
 
 the Bogfather is not real, or rather, the Bogfather is not a god. it is believed that the Bogfather is split into 5 aspects that can act separately from each other. as such, the church is split up into 5 sections each in charge of a different aspect of Boggish life.
 - Aspect of war: kinda self explanatory. this part acts as high command for the Boggish military
 - Aspect of Bogs: In charge of all agriculture done in Bogland. 
 - Aspect of Judgement: in charge of keeping the peace in cities and the Boggish courts
 - Aspect of Death: in charge of making sure the dead make it to bogs. also act as doctors and battlefield medics
 - Aspect of Secrets: in charge of Boggish Artifice. The [[Unseen]] is also a part of this. 
Early in their lives, every Boggish citizen is supposed to chooses one of these aspects to devote their lives to. Boggish cathedrals tend to be devoted to a single one of these aspects with the city they are built in being mainly devoted to that aspect. for example, a city with a cathedral of war may be focused on training soldiers and have barracks for reserves. 
#### Avatars
it is believed that in times of great need the Bogfather will send an exceptional individual to represent one of his aspects. The church call these individuals Avatars. Due to the nature of Bogland always being at war, Avatars of War are the most common. the most recent Avatar of War, of course, Being Syrr George Toadsquire. Cathedrals of a particular aspect tend to have art of past Avatars.
